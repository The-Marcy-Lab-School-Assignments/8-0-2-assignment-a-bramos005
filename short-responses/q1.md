# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
when you make an api call from the client, anyone can see your api key and decide to use it. On the server, this problem is eliminated because noeone except you and anyone you trusted with the server has access to the server logs and activity.
